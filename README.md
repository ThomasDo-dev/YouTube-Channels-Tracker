## YouTube Data Analysis Project  

This project fetches video and channel data from the YouTube API, processes it, and stores it in a database for analysis. The system retrieves video statistics, filters out Shorts, and optimizes API calls to reduce quota usage. The database is designed to efficiently store and manage video metadata, making it easy to analyze trends and insights over time.
